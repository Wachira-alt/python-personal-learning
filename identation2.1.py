'''
Code Block: a collection of code that is interpreted together. Python groups code blocks by indentation level.
Indentation is a central concept of Python programming. New lines with indentations are required after certain statements. Without proper indentation, your code will be interrupted by an IndentationError.

Where Are Indentations Necessary?
Indentations are required on each new line inside of a code block. Code blocks can begin with a number of keywords or statements, but here are some of the most common:

class Definitions
Function and Method Definitions (following the keyword def)
if, elif, and else
try, except, and finally
for and while

'''
Spaces, not Tabs
PEP 8 guidelines state that indentations in Python should consist of spaces rather than tabs. Tabs are visually interpreted differently in different environments, so they are not advisable in production code.
'''
'''
Four Spaces Each Time
Every indentation in Python code should consist of four spaces. This is long enough to distinguish between indentation levels but short enough to provide space for indentation levels in several nested code blocks.
